Medium Article Find this project's complete description at this Medium article . CRISP-DM Framework Business Problem This project aims to create classifier to predict the probability of a customer to convert when offered a financial product (direct term deposit) via a phone call. Fixed-term : investment where money is deposited into an account at a financial institution. Term deposits are also known as certificates of deposit (CDs) or time deposits. Term deposits typically have higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts, but the funds are not accessible until the term ends. The Dataset can be found in this link, from UCI DS Repository Python Version This project was created using version 3.12.1 Modules uv >= 0.5.1 catboost >= 1.2.5 category-encoders >= 2.6.4 feature-engine >= 1.8.2 ipykernel >= 6.29.5 matplotlib >= 3.9.2 mkdocs >= 1.6.1 numpy == 1.26.4 pandas >= 2.2.3 scikit-learn >= 1.5.2 seaborn >= 0.13.2 ucimlrepo >= 0.0.7 Project Quick Start The instructions to run this project are really simple. See them next. . . . Running on Jupyter Notebook Install the modules and run the notebook. pip install *module_name* Running with Jupyter nb does not require to install the module uv . . . . Running with IDE Open a terminal Install the module uv for virtual environment management Run pip install uv Run the command uv init crispdm (or use another name you like for the project) Access the folder created using bash command such as cd folder_name Set the Python version for your project with pyenv local 3.12.1 Create the virtual environment with uv venv --python 3.12.1 Install the python modules with uv add catboost, category_encoders, feature_engine, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, ucimlrepo Run the code as a python file.
